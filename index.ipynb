These measuring tools, which individuals are more likely to have at home, might be able to flag individuals with an increased risk of hypertension.\n","\n","[Researchers in Brazil](https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/637635) collected data from several hundred college students in order to answer this question.

Perform a Train-Test Split\n","\n","Load the data into a dataframe using pandas, separate the features (`X`) from the target (`y`), and use the `train_test_split` function to separate data into training and test sets.\n","\n","#### 2. Build and Evaluate a First Simple Model\n","\n","Using the `LinearRegression` model and `mean_squared_error` function from scikit-learn, build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using the training data. Also, use `cross_val_score` to simulate unseen data, without actually using the holdout test set.\n","\n","#### 3. Use `PolynomialFeatures` to Reduce Underfitting\n","\n","Apply a `PolynomialFeatures` transformer to give the model more ability to pick up on information from the training data. Test out different polynomial degrees until you have a model that is perfectly fit to the training data.\n","\n","#### 4. Use Regularization to Reduce Overfitting\n","\n","Instead of a basic `LinearRegression`, use a `Ridge` regression model to apply regularization to the overfit model. In order to do this you will need to scale the data. Test out different regularization penalties to find the best model.\n","\n","#### 5. Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n","\n","Preprocess `X_test` and `y_test` appropriately in order to evaluate the performance of your final model on unseen data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 1.

Most importantly, we are avoiding *leakage* of information from the test set into the training set. Leakage can lead to inflated metrics, since the model has information about the \"unseen\" data that it won't have about real unseen data. This is why we always want to fit our transformers and models on the training data only, not the full dataset.\n","2. Also, we want to make sure the code we have written will actually work on unseen data.

have already labeled a model as `final_model` above, make sure you understand why: this is the model with the best (lowest) validation RMSE. We also improved the train RMSE somewhat as well, meaning that our modeling strategy has actually reduced both underfitting and overfitting!\n","\n","The impact of the changes made so far has been minimal, which makes sense given our business context.

Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n","\n","Often our lessons leave out this step because we are focused on other concepts, but if you were to present your final model to stakeholders, it's important to perform one final analysis on truly unseen data to make sure you have a clear idea of how the model will perform in the field.\n","\n","### Instantiating the Final Model\n","\n","Unless you are using a model that is very slow to fit, it's a good idea to re-create it from scratch prior to the final evaluation.

In this case, maybe your model would still be useful for epidemiological modeling (predicting the blood pressure in populations) rather than predicting blood pressure for an individual, since we are picking up on some information.
